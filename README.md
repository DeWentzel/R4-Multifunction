# R4-Multifunction

This is a code for a Arduino UNO R4 Wi-Fi that makes it multi-functional. 
The code displays a menu with submenus on a OLED display, displays the current weather, has a webserver, reads distance from an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor and displays it.  For now, the webserver is just to start the screensaver remotely and turning on and 
off an LED on pin 13 (The Built in LED). The code does the following:

Displays a home screen 

Displays a menu

Displays Distance from an Ultrasonic Sensor

Displays Current Weather

Displays a simple animation

Displays info for webserver

Buttons to controll arduino from a webserver


*NOTE: If you want to acces the webserver, you will have to enter the R4's IP adress in your web browser. 
You can find the IP adress under the "INFO" Tab in the menu on the OLED display.
